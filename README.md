## About Product Database

Our site runs on a Flask server, using PostgreSQL for the database. The front end is simple CSS/JS using Bootstrap. This app was created for Database Design and Development (CS4092) at the University of Cincinnati.

## Setup Steps

1. Create and start a database on pgadmin, take note of all login info

2. Edit the `.envtemplate` to `.env` and then fill in the information accordingly

3. Run the `product_database\database\Setup.py` file to create the tables and insert dummy data

4. Ensure libraries are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Run the `run.py` file in the background

6. Navigate [here](http://localhost:5000/) to access the site
